# Pokémon
## Azure PokéDex Pipeline!

This ADO pipeline is designed to generate a Pokédex entry for the selected Pokémon. An HTML file will be generated as a pipeline artifact with all kinds of information on the selected Pokémon.

TODO:
- Better styling of the HTML artifact
- Add images to Evolution line
- After generating, convert html doc to PDF for easier viewing
